###RACES###
<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>This shows all the races I've run since my first in September 2012.  For each race I've plotted an assessment of my performance against the number of kilometres I ran in training in the previous 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The performance assessment is almost identical to the fitness measure described <a HREF="fitness.html">here</A>, but rather than using my actual heart rate during the race, it uses an expected heart rate based on the race distance (175bpm for a HM, higher for shorter races, lower for longer races).</p>
<p>The points are colour-coded: <font color='#ff0000'>marathon</font>, <font color='#ff8000'>half-marathon</font>, <font color='#ffd700'>10k</font>, <font color='#32cd32'>5k</font>.  Hover over a point to see more details.</p>
<p>You'd expect a strong correlation here, and that's what you see - training more in the 3 months before a race leads to me doing better in that race.  But it's no guarantee of success.</p>
