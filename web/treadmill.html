This is my Sole F85 treadmill, which I have set up in a basement room.  I bought it in November 2014 and it was expensive!
I reckon it will eventually work out cheaper than a gym membership, and I'll use it more because it's so convenient.
So to keep me honest, here's the latest usage data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Owned for:      175 days
<li>Times used:     57</li>
<li>Distance run:   403km</li>
<li>Cost per km:    &pound;3.97</li>
<li>Cost per run:   &pound;28.00</li>
</ul><p>And for comparison, this is how I did when I was a member of a gym:</p>
<ul>
<li>Member for:     1 year
<li>Times used:     29</li>
<li>Distance run:   326km</li>
<li>Cost per km:    &pound;0.61</li>
<li>Cost per run:   &pound;6.00</li>
</ul></DIV>
